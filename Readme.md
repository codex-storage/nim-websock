Websocket for Nim

We're working towards an implementation of the
[Websocket](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) protocol for
[Nim](https://nim-lang.org/). This is very much a work in progress, and not yet
in a usable state.

Building and testing
--------------------

Install dependencies:

```bash
nimble install -d
```

Run tests:
